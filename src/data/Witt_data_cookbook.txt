currImg = display that was shown
subj = subject ID
resp = quadrant that was selected (A-D)
corrQuad = quandrant for which mean of the dots was located (A-D)
distToMiddle = the distance from the mean of the dots to the center of all 4 quadrants
meanSD - the standard deviation of all the dots
isColSame - whether the quadrant for the mean of the red dots is the same quadrant as the mean of all the dots
isSizeSame - whether the quadrant for the mean of the bigdots is the same quadrant as the mean of all the dots
isPulseSame - whether the quadrant for the mean of the dots with black outlines is the same quadrant as the mean of all the dots
howManyCorr - how many of the special groups (red, big, black outlines) have their mean in the same quadrant as the quadrant for the full group of dots.

Dots were placed on a grid from 0 - 100 (arbitrary units).
